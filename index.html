        <p class="lead mb-4">Some of my previous work experiences include volunteering at Emanate Health hospital, working as an election worker, working at Sunright Tea Studio Boba, and working at Golden Vision Optometry. At Emanate Health hospital I was an Emergency Department Ambassador. My job included welcoming in patients, taking note of basic vitals and history (like temperature, symptoms, age, medical history, etc,), helping patients then check in (verifying insurance and helping nurses have them seated), transporting patients, directing patients throughout the hospital, and more. This volunteering experience allowed me to not only gain insight on what it was like to work in very high energy, stressful environments, but also how to think quickly on my feet and call for the doctors’ or nurses’ help right away depending on what I noticed or symptoms that may have been fatal for some patients. 
  <br><br>

        My experience as an Los Angeles County election student worker included responsibilities like welcoming and assisting voters through the voting experience, helping register new voters, updating voter information, verifying the identity of voters, and being able to use and teach voters how to use the new voting machines. This work experience of mine taught me a lot about how the voting process worked and how to work on my interpersonal skills when talking to voters or directing them in the right direction on how to use the new technology.My experience at Sunright Tea Studio Boba included taking orders, cooking boba and other various toppings (like cream pudding, mochi, yellow pudding, creme brulee, etc.), straining and making fresh tea, preparing drinks according to the menu, and restocking/refilling ingredients, etc. This job taught me a lot about interpersonal skills and how to deal with various different types of customers. This was also one of my first job experiences so for the first time, I dealt with serving customers, cooking and preparing food in very busy and high stress environments, and had to do a lot of memorization when it came to the recipes of the drinks or even the recipes when preparing ingredients. 
<br><br>

        	My experience at Golden Vision Optometry in their Rowland Heights branch included responsibilities like taking patient pre-tests, scheduling appointments, working alongside optometrists, checking insurance eligibility, assisting in frame pricing, etc. When doing patient pre-tests I learned and utilized machines like aberrometers, slit lamps, optical biometers, CT scans, and Optos imaging machines and wrote down and gave the data to the doctors to help in their diagnosing and appointments with various different patients. There was a lot of administration work and working with a lot of different patients. A large number of patients did not speak English so this job allowed me to test my language skills in both Spanish and Vietnamese. Also, working alongside optometrists gave me more insight into the optometry world of the medical field and the things and tips the doctors have each taught me were very valuable.
